## General Usage Notes and Application

CrimeEye is a web application that enables users to view and report crime incidents in real-time. The backend development of this app is coded in Python, while the front end is programmed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Heatmap.js and jQuery are used for map making. The data is taken from an ongoing database of Los Angeles Crime found on the data.gov website. Users can sign up and log in to the app securely through user authentication and authorization features. Once logged in, they can see a heatmap of Los Angeles that displays the density of crime incidents in different areas. The app allows users to report incidents in real-time, which are immediately visible on the map. A notification system alerts users about incidents reported in their area, and a search feature enables them to look for specific crimes by type or location. Additionally, data visualization tools such as charts and graphs are integrated into the app to help users better understand the crime trends in different parts of Los Angeles. All this is for the protection and betterment of wellbeing for all those looking to stay informed and safe.
